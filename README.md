# Mind-Voice
Learning to build a voice-interface with mind-maps. Learning everything from scratch Feb/17/18

Hello world! I am a student in college and I take a lot of notes, so mind-maps are the go-to choice for for me, but I have an idea: What if we could creates beautiful mindmaps just by speaking to it? 

The potential benefits are that it can make materials more memorable because of sight, speaking and the listening involved. Perhaps people driving have to record down a massive chunk of information and needs them organised. Or maybe record down words from the professor and have it generated into a mind-map.

In this project, I will start by learning python
